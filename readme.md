# Terminal CRM Application

The Terminal CRM Application is a lightweight customer relationship management (CRM) system that operates on the terminal/command line. It allows users to manage customer information, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting customer records. This application is built using Node.js and uses a JSON file to store customer data.

## Features

The Terminal CRM Application offers the following CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities:

- **Create**: Users can enter customer details, including first name, last name, sex, and date of birth, and store them in the system.
- **Read**: Users can view the list of existing customers and their information.
- **Update**: Users can modify the details of a specific customer, such as their name, sex, or date of birth.
- **Delete**: Users can delete a customer record from the system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

### Data Persistence

### Error Handling

The application provides basic error handling for scenarios such as invalid inputs, missing data, or file system errors. Error messages will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt to assist with troubleshooting.
